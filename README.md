# searchlite

![searchlite logo](assets/searchlite-no-bg.svg)

A simple Python package that allows semantic search with simple syntax on **small** text data sets.

## Features

- Easily embed and index collections of texts with a variety of embedding methods:
  - scikit-learn's TFIDF
  - Any embedding model from Ollama
  - Any embedding model from the sentence_transformers package
  - Any API-based embedding workflow
- Query with natural language to find the most semantically similar texts
- Display results with multiple formatting options (`f-string`, `pprint`, `tabulate`)
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies by default

## Scaling Considerations

`searchlite` is intentionally designed for **lightweight semantic search** on **small to moderately sized** text datasets that fit in memory. It excels in use cases like:

* Prototyping search workflows
* Performing quick, local experiments
* Building educational or notebook-based tools
* Evaluating embedding strategies

Because embeddings are stored in memory using NumPy arrays, `searchlite` is **not optimized for large-scale corpora or long-term persistence**.

## Working with Large Datasets?

If you're working with large text datasets or need production-grade semantic search with features like:

* Efficient vector indexing
* Disk-based or cloud-based storage
* Scalable nearest neighbor search
* Metadata filtering and advanced retrieval

You should consider using a dedicated vector database such as:

* [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/)
* [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/)
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)

These libraries offer Python SDKs and built-in support for embedding and querying at scale.

## Installation

Currently, **searchlite** is not published on PyPI.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/searchlite.git
cd searchlite
````

2. Install dependencies (recommend creating a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The `sentence-transformers` library currently requires `numpy` version less than 2. Please ensure you have `numpy<2` installed to avoid compatibility issues.

## Usage Example

```python
from searchlite.document import Document
import pandas as pd
import os

current_file_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
data_path = os.path.join(current_file_path, "../data/synthetic_data.csv")

sample_df = pd.read_csv(data_path, index_col=0)
sample_texts = sample_df["text"]
sample_metadata = sample_df[["id", "category"]].to_dict(orient="records")

doc = Document(texts=sample_texts, metadata=sample_metadata)

print(doc)

doc.embed()

res = doc.query(query_text="wireless earbuds with good battery life")

print(res)

doc.display_results(res, options="tabulate")
```

```

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Core dependencies:

  * `numpy < 2`
  * `scikit-learn >= 1.0`
  * `tabulate >= 0.8.0`
  * `pandas >= 1.0`

* Optional dependencies:

  * Sentence Transformers
    * `sentence-transformers >= 2.2.0`
  * Ollama
    * `ollama`
  * Dev
    * `pytest`

You can find the full list in [setup.py](setup.py) or [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

**Note:** 

If you want to use SentenceTransformer-based embeddings, youâ€™ll need to install the optional dependency:

```bash
pip install searchlite[sentence_transformers]
```

Or, install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_st.txt
```

If you want to use Ollama-based embeddings, you'll need to install the optional dependency:

```bash
pip install searchlite[ollama]
```

Or, install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_ollama.txt
```

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, feel free to open an issue or submit PRs.

This is my first Python package project, built as a learning experience, so I truly appreciate constructive feedback and ideas for improvement.

## A Note on AI

This README was written with the help of Chat GPT. I also used Chat GPT to generate the synthetic data used in the tests and in the notebook demo. **All code, however, was written by me!** I strongly believe in transparency when it comes to the use of generative AI. In that spirit, you can visit [chat-gpt-prompt.md](chat-gpt-prompt.md) to see the **exact** prompt I used to help me reason through problems and think critically while designing seachlite. :)

## Future Plans
